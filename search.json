    "text": "Welcome to The Accidental Data Scientists—a not-so-subtle nod to the legendary George Box and his autobiography, which you should absolutely read. Box famously said he didn’t choose to become a statistician; necessity led him down this wonderfully twisted statistical rabbit hole—a journey many of us know all too well. My path was similar, though admittedly less perilous (no developing Nazi countermeasures for me, just a lot of entrepreneurial research). You might call that “necessity-driven” career planning. This blog was born somewhere between a mid-career crisis and a statistics-induced existential reckoning. Beyond the personal stories and statistical musings, I’ll also share what I believe ails our field most: a chronic lack of clear thinking with data. Too often, researchers lean on formulas, models, and tests like checklists—missing the bigger picture and nuance that real insight demands. You’ll find this critique weaved through many posts as a common thread.\nThis blog is part therapy (mostly for me, not you) and part thematic exploration. It chronicles my personal journey and how it shaped the researcher I am today—take that for good or bad. As you read along, I hope you’ll find some of my experiences useful for reflecting on your own. Everything here is my personal opinion. Acknowledging that much of what passes for “knowing” in statistics is really just well-informed opinion is a crucial first step on the road to progress. You’re perfectly free to disagree. And yes, I’m occasionally wrong—because, after all, being a scientist means rarely being absolutely certain, but always being eager to learn when you’re mistaken.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      \n    \n\n\n\n\n\nPlaceholder\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmethods\n\n\nopinions\n\n\ngrumpy-statistics\n\n\n\nPlaceholder\n\n\n\n\n\nAug 11, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

Under this section, I’ll be tirelessly working to help you drift off to sleep with some of my most “exciting” academic findings. Think of it as a free, open-access alternative to chamomile tea: carefully crafted to satisfy the intellectually curious, yet perfectly capable of lulling you into a peaceful nap.

    "text": "Image credit: Photo by Mulyadi on Unsplash\nIn this project, my co-authors and I tackle a classic entrepreneurial dilemma: how to be different enough to get noticed, but not so different that people think you’ve lost the plot. This balancing act—optimal distinctiveness—is our research playground. We dig into how audiences judge ventures and how the rules change in quirky niche markets and across international borders. Lately, we’re especially obsessed with how this sweet spot shifts over time. Working papers will appear here once they’re presentable (and possibly after they’ve stopped arguing with reviewers). With a few papers under review, we’re cautiously optimistic about sharing good news soon."

    "text": "Welcome to my website, where I attempt to escape the tight norms of university web presences. I’m a data-driven social scientist working at the intersection of strategy, marketing, organizational sociology—and just a little bit of chaos theory. My research explores how entrepreneurs manage the balancing act between standing out and fitting in—what scholars like to call optimal distinctiveness. I’m especially interested in how they use cultural tools like narratives, imagery, and video to navigate this space. I rely on large-scale digital data and computational methods like NLP and image recognition to make sense of how entrepreneurial ventures behave. If it’s messy, unstructured, and vaguely text-adjacent, I probably want to analyze it.\nProfessionally, I’m a bit of a journeyman. Born and bred in my hometown, where I completed both my studies and PhD (because why not?), I’ve since wandered through Vancouver’s stunning Sea-to-Sky corridor, Oslo’s majestic fjords, and Siegen’s deep forests before settling into my current academic home in Tilburg, The Netherlands. You could say I took a scenic route—from the Rockies, over Scandinavian mountains, all the way down to a country famous for being below sea level. So, I guess you could say I’ve become an expert in downward trajectories — both geographic and academic.\nOn this site, you’ll find my blog — The Accidental Data Scientist — along with a peek into my research and the occasional random thought I feel like sharing. Dive in, and enjoy the ride!"
