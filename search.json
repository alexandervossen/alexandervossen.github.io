    "text": "Welcome to The Accidental Data Scientists—a not-so-subtle nod to the legendary George Box and his autobiography, which you should absolutely read. Box famously said he didn’t choose to become a statistician; necessity led him down this wonderfully twisted statistical rabbit hole—a journey many of us know all too well. My path was similar, though admittedly less perilous (no developing Nazi countermeasures for me, just a lot of entrepreneurial research). You might call that “necessity-driven” career planning. This blog was born somewhere between a mid-career crisis and a statistics-induced existential reckoning. Beyond the personal stories and statistical musings, I’ll also share what I believe ails our field most: a chronic lack of clear thinking with data. Too often, researchers lean on formulas, models, and tests like checklists—missing the bigger picture and nuance that real insight demands. You’ll find this critique weaved through many posts as a common thread.\nThis blog is part therapy (mostly for me, not you) and part thematic exploration. It chronicles my personal journey and how it shaped the researcher I am today—take that for good or bad. As you read along, I hope you’ll find some of my experiences useful for reflecting on your own. Everything here is my personal opinion. Acknowledging that much of what passes for “knowing” in statistics is really just well-informed opinion is a crucial first step on the road to progress. I’m happy to help you get going — feel free to disagree, of course. Yes, I’m occasionally wrong, because being a scientist means rarely being absolutely certain but always being eager to learn when mistaken.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy I No Longer Chase Statistical Trends (and Why You Probably Shouldn’t Either)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmethods\n\n\nopinions\n\n\ngrumpy-statistics\n\n\n\nHot Takes in Cold Blood\n\n\n\n\n\nNov 19, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "section": "Mind over Model",
    "text": "Mind over Model\nA few weeks ago, I found myself in a conversation about whether a particular research question could “only” be answered with a DAG. Not a DAG in the everyday sense, but a DAG™, the modern badge of causal purity. Someone confidently declared: “Well, only a DAG can answer this.” (Find out more about DAGs here).\nAnd there I was again, wondering how researchers have managed to answer questions for the last decades without collapsing into a puddle of epistemological despair. Surely some knowledge must have slipped through the cracks before? That’s really why I’ve grown skeptical of methodological trends: Every few years a new method arrives promising that everything we did before was wrong — until next year, when another method arrives to declare that one wrong too.\nMeanwhile, when you listen to the genuinely good statisticians and econometricians — the ones who have been quietly producing excellent work for decades — they almost never talk that way. They don’t say: “This method is wrong.” They say: “If you use this method, you are making the following assumptions.” And that distinction matters. If your software converges and produces results, the model isn’t “wrong.” It runs. The real question is: What inferences are you allowed to draw, given the assumptions you just bought into?\nNo method is exempt from this. Every method has assumptions. And, as Pedro Sant’anna puts it beautifully in his lecture slides:  Our job as researchers is to assess the pros and cons of each method in their ability to answer the questions we (and the business/policy makers/stakeholders) care about."

    "section": "Progress Is Real… But So Are Its Blind Spots",
    "text": "Progress Is Real… But So Are Its Blind Spots\nLet me be clear: I’m not anti-progress. We do have better tools, better computation, sharper theory. But that doesn’t automatically make our research “better.” Replications haven’t suddenly skyrocketed because we switched from SPSS to Python. Publication bias is alive and thriving (now with prettier tables). And many of the simulation studies used to validate new methods model worlds so unrealistically pristine they make children’s television look gritty.\nSo yes, progress is real — but over the years, I’ve developed a real appreciation for a more measured (pun intended) approach to improving our tools, rather than the bold promise of the next big thing that supposedly “solves it all.” Nothing has reminded me of this more vividly than Bueno de Mesquita and Fowler (2021) Thinking Clearly with Data, in which they which presents their beautifully simple “favorite equation”:\n\nEstimate = Estimand + Bias + Noise\n\nThe estimand is the thing you actually want to know — the true effect or quantity of interest. The estimate is what you end up getting. Bias is systematic distortion between the two. Noise is everything random that refuses to behave.\nWe never observe the estimand directly. We only approximate it, and every approximation drags bias and noise along like barnacles on a ship. No shiny causal ML method, no DAG, no deep neural net can completely wash these off in real data. At best, they rearrange the barnacles. If you don’t know what your estimand really is, no model — old or new — will save you."

    "section": "When Methods Turn Into Fashion Accessories",
    "text": "When Methods Turn Into Fashion Accessories\nThis is where the trend-chasing bothers me. Every year brings another wave of implied moral judgment: Regression? Naive. Fixed effects? Cute. Matching? Outdated. Anything invented before your PhD coursework? Suspicious.\nI like machine learning. I use it. I teach it. But there is a difference between liking a tool and thinking clearly with it. With a simple regression, I can sit down with ten numbers, compute everything by hand, and understand every step. With many ML methods that clarity vanishes. Defaults take over; optimizers do mysterious things; and if someone pushes me deep enough on intuition, there is a non-zero chance I start drawing vague diagrams on a whiteboard to buy time. That doesn’t make ML bad. It simply means that methods only help thinking if we can reason through them."

    "section": "So Where Does This Leave Us?",
    "text": "So Where Does This Leave Us?\nWhich brings me back to that “only DAGs can answer this” conversation. The problem isn’t DAGs — DAGs are powerful and elegant when used thoughtfully. The problem is the mindset: the belief that correctness lives in the tool rather than in the clarity of assumptions and the suitability of the design. After a decade of analyzing data, teaching methods, reviewing papers, and staring at margins plots at unholy hours, I’ve learned this much:\n\nUnderstand your estimand before touching your estimator.\nExpect bias and noise; they’re loyal companions.\nDon’t worship statistical trends; use what fits your question.\nBe wary of anyone who claims there is only one “right” way of doing a certain analysis.\n\nIf you want flashy certainty, statistics is the wrong hobby. If you want humble approximations, thoughtful assumptions, and occasional existential crises… welcome aboard - don’t mind the barnacles!"

    "text": "Image credit: Photo by Mulyadi on Unsplash\nIn this project, my co-authors and I tackle a classic entrepreneurial dilemma: how to be different enough to get noticed, but not so different that people think you’ve lost the plot. This balancing act—optimal distinctiveness—is our research playground. We dig into how audiences judge ventures and how the rules change in quirky niche markets and across international borders. Lately, we’re especially obsessed with how this sweet spot shifts over time. Working papers will appear here once they’re presentable (and possibly after they’ve stopped arguing with reviewers). With a few papers under review, we’re cautiously optimistic about sharing good news soon."
