Welcome to my research section—home to thrilling adventures in statistical models, obscure theoretical debates, and tables so wide you’ll need a second monitor just to scroll through them. Under this section, I’ll be tirelessly working to help you drift off to sleep with some of my most “exciting” academic findings. Think of it as a free, open-access alternative to chamomile tea: carefully crafted to satisfy the intellectually curious, yet perfectly capable of lulling you into a peaceful nap. Enjoy and now relax...
